# Flight-Operations-Delay-Insights-Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents a clean and insightful Power BI dashboard analyzing flight delays, cancellations, and performance patterns using a Kaggle dataset. It helps visualize key KPIs, delay trends by time and day, and airline-wise comparisons to quickly understand operational challenges.
